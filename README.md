This is my first full-stack completely self-made personal project, from concept to copy.  I came up with the idea while staying with a friend in the countryside staring out the window (as you do!) at the village community/parish noticeboard and wondering why on earth that doesn't exist on the internet.  And why can't we do it better.  We are so focused on globalisation and connecting people far away from each other, we neglect connecting people and services near to each other.  So my plan is to rectify this.

## Key Features

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A global noticeboard, for local issues.

 - Anyone can view the local noticeboard from anywhere in the world.  Just open up the app and it auto-populates a noticeboard based on proximity to the user; weighing up important notice attributes like proximity/relevance/age/popularity/MASS.  Then by scrolling around the map, any user can easily view any noticeboard from anywhere in the world.  Going on holiday, moving to a new area?  Just checkout out the local noticeboard to see what that community is up to!

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free for local postings

- Anyone can post a notice for free, but only to their local vicinity.  To increase a notice's reach, a small sliding fee scale is used to increase the MASS of a notice, so that it can pull in more users from further away.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community Accountability

- A KEY concept is that users cannot "choose" where to post their notice to the global noticeboard. They can only post to their account's physical address.  Physical addresses will need to be confirmed, either by physical post/telephone billing address/electoral registry.  A user WILL NOT be allowed to post to the global noticeboard without confirming their address first.  The accountability of locality is intristic to community spirit of Notice.  Just like, you know... the real world!  Without hands-on moderation Notice with use other tools such as it's algorihthm and recommendations to promote relevance and civic responsibility.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boundaryless connections

- The main thing that connects people on Notice is proximity.  Proximity will be modulated by population density but otherwise, notional borders are superfluous.  Community, without the tribalism.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creativity is key

- The best way to get visibility is to let loose your own creativity.  Upload your own images of flyers, posters or business cards!  Each notice can have front AND back content, which will flip over when you view it.  So no need to clutter your cover with text heavy details.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed Noticeboards

- Anyone will also be able to create their own Noticeboards.  These can be for whatever reason you like!  A household, a community club, a group of friends on holiday?  These can be fully ring-fenced and secure, and based on location and WILL NOT interact with notices on the global noticeboard.  They will not be searchable by default, but if associated with a real address, they can be pushed to the global map.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy at every level for every user

- Users will have complete control over who can see their notice.  Just confirmed local residents?  Specific local residents? Just non-local users?  Contact information will also have multiple privacy settings.  And don't worry, you'll have the ability to mute annoying neighbours ;)

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community discourse

- Every notice has the option to create it's own sub-noticeboard for further discussion.  These discussion noticeboards aren't based on location, so anyone can post!  They can also be moderated by the owner of the original notice.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Recommendations

- One of the key problems Notice would like to solve is how to find good, reliable and trustworthy local services.  So for example if you're looking for a dog-walker, you can seach for all dog-walker notices in the near-by area, each of which will have a local recommendation score.  This local recommendation score can be boosted through several means.  A reddit-style liking system will be key, but the score you see will be heavily weighted in favour of residents near to you.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community Census

- Fancy taking the temperature on a local issue?  Put out a community census only available to local residents.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super Users

- Local authorities and other key organisations with have super access to Notice.  We will work with local councils to make sure they can get pertinent information to the right people.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives

- Now this is very VERY much still in it's infancy conceptually.  But I'm worried the global Noticeboard is a little 'flat' organisationally so think some form of loose authority/moderation figures might be necessary to keep us all civic, civil and civilised, and decide on edge cases.  There may be some kind of voting system, some form of emergent continuous constituencies, but what form exactly this will take I'm not sure as of yet.  I do know that I DON'T want it to based on a fixed constituency.  Some kind of continuous Proportional Representation. Maybe popular users' actions will have more weight in certain decisions.  Maybe discrete individuals will actually be elected and have a term of "office".  Who knows?! It could be a really exciting platform to experiment with Democracy 2.0. :)

## Tech Stack

I like Javascript :).  So it's going to be full-stack Javascript for the time being.  I'm fresh faced and fancy free out of a 3-month bootcamp and still very much new to everything so VERY much learning as I go.  Although I do have some wishful aspirations of starting the next Gumtree, this is just as much a learning process.
